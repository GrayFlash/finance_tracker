We are using Google CLoud OCR and we hence didn't deploy that part cause Google Vision is having free access for 1000 requests per month, and the credentials are from our billing account.
Also the ML code is on a flask server and is connected with OCR, so we were unable to depploy it for free anywhere. Wish to help us with that let us know by creating an issue.

If any App demo is needed please contact us, cause we will to discuss it with anyone intrested.
