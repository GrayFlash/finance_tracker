## What is Finance Tracker?

**Finance Tracker** is a mobile application which helps you to keep track of your daily expences.

<hr>
Hmmmm.... Don't wanna read the whole readme? Just keep scrolling, we have added screenshots of each and every component, you will get a direct idea from it. Also you can find a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqDO2ruW7Fo&feature=youtu.be">YouTube Video</a> that we have made explaining the whole app.

## How it works?

<p>As you can see it contains 4 main pages. Curious to know about it? Let's give you a quick tour to each of them.</p>

<div align="center">

<h2>Home Page</h2>

<h4>1. Expenses</h4> 
<p>This shows all the categories of your products and renders your previous expenses. It also shows the total amout you spent this month. As you clicks on a particular category it will render all the previous expenses on that particular category on the PREVIOUS EXPENSES section as show in the image. </p>

<h6>What if I want to edit or delete a particular category?</h6>
<p>So in the PREVIOUS EXPENSES section it renders the expenses in the form of card. On pressing one of this card it will allow you to edit details of the particular item.</p>

</div>

<h4>2. Pie Chart</h4> 
<p>Hmmm.. this one seems to be pretty simple. Yup! this component shows a detailed pie chart of your expense according to your category. As you clicks on any of the category mentioned bellow that particular part of the category in the pie chart will glow up.
This pie chart also shows the percentage amount you spent on a particular category so that you can keep track of on which category you are spending more. </p>

</div>

<h4>3. Add Page</h4> 
<p>Here we go... The main functionality of this app. You can scan your bill here.</p>

<h6>What if I want to add only 1 or 2 product and don't have any bill?</h6>
<p>As you can see we added a separate form just bellow the "Scan your Bill" button where you can add your product manually.</p>


<div align="center">
<img height="800px" src="https://github.com/GrayFlash/finance_tracker/blob/main/expo/assets/readme_images/addpage.jpg">
</div>
<br>

<p>This is what it looks like when you click "Scan your Bill" button. You can either scan your bill using your camera or can even import the image of your bill from gallery.</p>
<br>

<div align="center">
<img height="800px" src="https://github.com/GrayFlash/finance_tracker/blob/main/expo/assets/readme_images/scan.jpg">
</div>
<br>

<p>After scanning your bill it will render all your scanned products so that you can confirm all your products for once and can upload them by clicking on "Done" button. Can also cancel by clicking on any of the other components in header.</p>
